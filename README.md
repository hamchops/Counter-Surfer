# Counter-Surfer
##Counter surfer video game

Counter Surfer is a side scrolling platformer made after one of my dogs. The goal is to try and stay on the counter as long as possible while avoiding obstacles and your human. Get ready to experience the same high speed adrenaline rush your 4 legged friends gets while surfing counters in your own kitchen.

**Project Details**

This is an early version of the game that has most of the game skeleton. It was constructed using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. The already has game assets and pictures already loaded in. Game mechanics are mostly there, but have some flaws. If you decide to work on animation, the largest problem is with the frame count for the character idle vs character in motion(e.g. running and sitting). Some code likes to make other game objects disappear when live, this can be replicated when creating a separate function for idle animation VS movement animation. Other than that have fun and feel free to reach out to collaborate on how you improved my code(always ready to learn).
