# Counter-Surfer
Counter surfer video game

Counter Surfer is a side scrolling platformer made after one of my dogs. The goal is to try and stay on the counter as long as possible while avoiding obstacles and your human. Get ready to experience the same high speed adrenaline rush your 4 legged friends gets while surfing counters in your own kitchen.
